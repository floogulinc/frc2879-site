Sponsorships are very important for our team to achieve our goals. All donations of funds, merchandise, materials and/or time helps our team succeed in our goals. We hope you will provide your support.

This year our goal is to build not only 1 robot but 2. The first will be packaged up early and sent off to wait for competition, the second will be left with us so we can practice our task and make modifications. This goal is going to be taxing to our budget, so we are asking our community members and businesses as well as anybody else to please help us out.
